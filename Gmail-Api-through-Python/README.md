# Using Gmail API and Python to read mail messages 

I personally find Gmail API to be a bit confusing for beginners. The APIâ€™s wizard comes handy to create the project, get credentials, and authenticate them. However, the process that should be followed after that is not mentioned clearly.

Therefore, I have created a sample Python script that does the following:
* Go to Gmal inbox
* Find and read all the unread messages
* Extract details (Date, Sender, Subject, Snippet, Body) and export them to a .csv file / DB
* Mark the messages as Read - so that they are not read again 


[Link to the script](https://github.com/abhishekchhibber/Gmail-Api-through-Python/blob/master/gmail_read.py)


Before running this script, the user should get the authentication by following 
the [Gmail API link](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python)
Also, client_secret.json should be saved in the same directory as this file


The script outputs a dictionary in the following format:

```
{	'Sender': '"email.com" <name@email.com>', 
	'Subject': 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit ametLorem ipsum dolor sit amet', 
	'Date': 'yyyy-mm-dd', 
	'Snippet': 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet'
	'Message_body': 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet'
  }
  ```



The dictionary can be exported as a .csv or into a databse
